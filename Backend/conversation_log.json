It is given by:\n\\[\n(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\n\\]\nSo, if you expand \\((a + b)^2\\), you get \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). If you need further clarification or examples, feel free to ask!"

I don't validate answers in real-time or access other APIs; instead, I rely on the knowledge I've been trained on to provide responses. My goal is to be as accurate and helpful as possible by using that knowledge. If you have any questions or need assistance with a specific topic, feel free to ask!"
